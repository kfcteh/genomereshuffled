--Potential storyline to teach how the assembly process works--

BCRail has assembled a shipment consisting of 4 cars to eastern canada.

1) see BCRail.agp for the mapping of the cars in the shipment BCRAIL_1.

2) currently the order of the cars are OILCAR-CORNCAR_1-CORNCAR_2-WHEATCAR.

3) however the organization of the contents of the car was messed up and 
   not optimized for distribution when the rail hits their destination(s).
   Distribution occurs from left car to right.

4) see CarContents.gff to see the contents and their relative 
   location within each car.
	4a) cars should be organized based on contents to make 
   	    distribution easier
	4b) contents are usually paired up and chained, but the 
	    chaining mechanism is orientation based.
		eg) 	  [x]- [y]-  are in facing forward (+). 
			Connect by flipping one them (-), 
			  [x]--[y] so like so:
			  box1(+) - box2(-)
	    *chaining can go through gaps/cars.


SOLUTION:

The correct fixes would be:

1) Move WHEATCAR right after OILCAR because of the linkage of box1 to box2, WHEATCAR remains +, because box1(+) works with box2(-).

2) Flip CORNCAR_2 to (-) orientation because in the current setup bigbag1 and bigbag2 are both (+).  So to chain, one of these has to flip.  Flipping CORNCAR_2 is the easiest.  Flipping CORNCAR_1 would require moving CORNCAR_2 as first car, but since halifax is last desitnation, keep the car to the right.
